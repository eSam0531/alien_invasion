Project 1 - From Textbook: Python Crash Course 2nd edition

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. Whe the game begins, a fleete of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys
the aliens. If the play shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the 
player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

Added the feature of the level up, level down, and reset buttons.

I still need to fix the level down button to be limited to 1 as the lowest level.
